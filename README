This repository is to display projects, and research of projects. 
Down below is a list of ideas and will also show the completion of these
projects. 


#### Idea Name #####-###################### Description ################################################
#                  #
#                  #    The radio tracker will use triangulation, 
# High speed Radio #  by sending out a pulse and measuring the time
#  Tracker         #  for a response. However, this time is really short
#                  #  we cannot hope to be presise with clock speed alone. 
#                  #  
#                  #  Therefore, my invention is to use a "capacitor clock" that 
# Progress:        #  will charge at a known rate. It starts its charge when the 
# Research Stage   #  pulse is sent out, and stops charging once the pulse returns.
#                  #
#                  #  The hope is that the capacitor will hold this charge,  
#                  #  that can be reverse calculated to time it took for the signal to bounce,
#                  #  then the computer can read the voltage value and calculate the distance. 
#                  # 
#                  #  With 3 "hub" recievers, we can then triangulate the position 
#                  #  with the 3 differnt distances.
